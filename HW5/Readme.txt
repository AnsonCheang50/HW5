So this homework have us use JQuery, and JSON in order to make
a scrabble game. However this game only have a singl line
which was provided in the graphics data folder, along with
the tile images, and the json object, except I transferred
the file to within the command.js file. I didnt have enough
time to implement the blank tiles, so the blank tiles default
to B, for some reason. I didnt do the extra credit, didnt have
time. Um lets see I did randomize the draw, and allowed dragging
between the rack and the board. I also implemented the reset and
submit word button, which should work. Also made it so that you can
only add to the beginning or end of the word(except for the first letter)
and remove from the beginning or the end of the word. also made a 
display for the word, word score, total score, and amount of tiles 
remaining. Although I couldnt find anyone else to test it so something might break,
that I didnt think of
